                        I can still remember our cab rides back from office bitching all about managers :p
                        Time has flied so fasst....it still feels like tomorrow. You are a self motivated person be the same and chase your dreams. Be it being a guitarist or an IIM student some day :P
                        Also Karen is a very sweet girl....we are expecting a good news soon :P<br>
                        I missed your concert in Bangalore though but want to experience it soon.
                        I hope my demands will be fulfilled one day as a return gift :D <br>
                        Happiest Birthday :)</p>

                        <p>Remember the cliche 'crossing paths' lines in the farewell mails?
                        <br>(The one Butter sent to other 'colleagues' :P)
                        <br>Sometimes they turn out to be true...
                        <br>Who would have thought that a <u><b>'Hello'</b></u> in 2011 would become <u><b>'World'</b></u> in 2020  
                        <br><br>Many of us have changed over the years. Rather situations have changed. 
                        <br>I am just glad our friendship did not get approvals for this change. 
                        <br>Still the same jokes, the same laughing sessions,
                        <br>A few additions may be...
                        <br>The small 'Indian Idol judge' function I go through every week,
                        <br>The choreography sessions, The Gully boy enactments
                        <br>A bit of trips out of Mumbai, a hell lot in Mumbai
                        <br>Cant have enough of those small bunk sessions.
                        <br>

                        Toast to all the moments that we've been through,
                        <br>Cheers to making new memories  with you!...<br><br>
                        HAPPIEST 24th BDAY VAYANKI .... AND HAPPY 3rd for us :P

                        <p>Hello Namita,
                            <br>From that "meko kal subah call karna  bus k liye please" to "aaj chalke jaate hai na"  and "aaj bunk karte hai kya" (though I have not been a part of those bunks üôà, you know na I wanted to give you both privacy) it's been a great journey. <br>While writing this all those memories are just coming into my mind. 
                            <br>The Bangalore days, Prism breakout me chai pe charcha, refuge area ki hawa and sunsets, Prism canteen k table pe panchat aur uska khana  (I know realise it's importance after moving to Magnus) , Garden k faware, Veeru bhai ki sawari, DJ sessions in bus,  Mahabaleshwar & Gokarna trips, that long walk talks to home, and so much more.  
                            <br><br>Ab toh aap bade log ban gaye ho, the perfect "boyfriend material" , a dancer, a guitarist, a singer,  a doodle artist , a cook,  a coder and what not, ypu are just adding things to your skill list.
                            <br>Last but not the least, Happy vala birthday Namita, enjoy your day and party karenge hard once this lockdown will get over !!!!
                            <br><br>P.S : I am yearning to hear "that" good news. Tell me fast!</p>

                        <p>Ahoyyy partner. <br>Writing this message brings back hell lot of wacky-Namita memories. Miss the cafeteria slow walk and those pointless but deep discussions. I somewhere thought the things would change when I join back after a year. But Kudos! Great things never change. Charamander knows she hasn't been in touch of a while, no excuses for that.
