This website used a combination of HTML5-up templates, specifically the phantom and solid-state templates. This website was made to cretively give Christina her birthday gift, tickets to a pokemon concert she wished to see. Instead of simply giving it to her, I created a series of pokemon trivia questions. After answering all of them correctly, I put some letters from her closest friends along with the tickets to the concert. Website is viewable at http://kevintee117.github.io/christina-20
